# Demo Todo App Using React and React-Bootsrap and Bootstrap.css

In our previous example, [js-todo-dom-only](https://github.com/mdogy/js-todo-dom-only) we stored our todos right in the DOM itself, and our events called functions that manipulated the DOM directly. This is only slightly less brain dead. React will allow us to separate our data from the DOM. We will store our data as "state" in our component object. We write code that renders the data out, from data to DOM. If we think of our data/state as "model" that is "model" renders to "view" ... what we see. Then we insert controllers to handle events in the DOM, but those what those "controllers" do to the "model" is implemented near the model ... they don't really sit in the rendering of the DOM, they just get passed there. This is a version of "Model"-"View"-"Controller". The controller changes the model. React lets the model effect the view. Nice one way flow.

Another advantage of this design is that the model, being a javascript object, is ready to be grabbed and possibly sent to a server. That is our next threshold. Meanwile digest this.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
